## Setup
Feel free to refer to the reference_report.html provided in the assignment repo.
This will let you see a preview of the output the report is intended to
generate, and this will be especially helpful for the sections that create
plots. The example report also displays the first few rows of all the data you
will be generating in each section for your reference. 

This assignment will make use of the
[RColorBrewer](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/38-rcolorbrewers-palettes.html)
package to choose an appropriate color palette for a heatmap in part 8. Please
make sure to install this package before starting.

We will be using three main datasets that are contained within the repo: 

1. example_intensity_data.csv - a dataframe containing the normalized intensity
values from a microarray experiment

2. proj_metadata.csv - a dataframe containing the associated metadata for the
samples of the experiment

3. differential_expression_results.csv - a dataframe containing the results of a
differential expression analysis on the probes from this experiment.

## 1. Read in the example_intensity_data
To begin, we will read in the same data you have used in previous experiments
(`example_intensity_data.csv`). This time, we do __not__ want to read it in as a
tibble as some of our downstream operations will not work correctly without
additional steps. 

__Write a function, `read_data`, that reads in the example_intensity_data.csv as
a *dataframe*. Return the first two rows of the dataframe below__:

```{r code block to read data}
intensity <- read_data('example_intensity_data.csv', ' ')
head(intensity, 2)
```
### Background on PCA 
PCA is an exploratory data analysis technique commonly used to reduce the
dimensionality of data while simultaneously minimizing information loss.
Understanding the inner workings of PCA will require an in-depth review of
linear algebra and is beyond the scope of this specific assignment. We will
provide several links and references if you wish to do so on your own. At its
core, PCA creates new uncorrelated linear combinations of the original variables
that successively maximize variance. Thus, the first principle component (PC)
represents the direction of the data that explains a maximal amount of variance.
The second PC represents the direction that captures the second most variance
and so on and so forth. As you can infer, if a small number of PCs capture a
majority of variance contained within a dataset, they can be used as a lower
dimensional representation of the data.

Before we perform PCA, we will transpose and scale our data. These topics are
covered in more detail in the course textbook and they are already implemented
in R as the base functions `t()` and `scale()`. First, we will transpose the
dataframe we generated in part 1 and scale the values before
performing PCA using `prcomp()`.

*Hint*: The `prcomp()` function has flags to center and scale data. As
we have already scaled our data, we will set both the center and scale flags to
FALSE.

__Run the code below as is to perform PCA on your dataframe that you read in
above.__

```{r code block to transpose, scale data and perform PCA}
pca_results <- prcomp(scale(t(intensity)), center=FALSE, scale=FALSE)
summary(pca_results)
```

## 2. Calculating the variance explained by Principal Components
Now that we have performed PCA, we are interested in the proportion of variance
explained by each principal component. This can be determined by dividing the
variance of each PC by the sum total of the variance of all PCs.

__Write a function, `calculate_variance_explained`, that calculates the
proportion of variance explained by each principal component from the
`pca_results` object and returns a *vector* of those values below.__

*Hint*: The standard deviation values of each PC may be accessed by
pca_results$sdev. Remember the relationship between standard deviation and
variance.

```{r code block to calculate variance}
pc_variance_explained <- calculate_variance_explained(pca_results)
pc_variance_explained
```

## 3. Make a tibble with variance explained and cumulative variance explained for the PCs
__Using the vector of variance explained values you just generated,
`pc_variance_explained`, write a function, `make_variance_tibble`, that uses
this vector along with the `pca_results` object to construct a *tibble* with
three columns containing the name of each PC, the variance explained by each PC,
and the cumulative sum of variance explained. Return the first five rows
below.__

```{r code block to construct a tibble with PCs, variance explained, and cumulative variance explained}
variance_tibble <- make_variance_tibble(pc_variance_explained, pca_results)
head(variance_tibble, 5)
```

### Create descriptive captions for plots here after you've finished
For the next few sections, we will be generating plots. It is customary to
provide descriptive captions for figures that succinctly state what's being
displayed. Browse a few scientific papers of your choice to get a sense for how
figure captions are structured and written. For the sections numbered 4, 5, 8,
please use the following code block to write descriptive captions for these
figures. We have assigned these captions to variables, and if you look at the
`{r code}` chunk for these parts (4, 5, 8), you will notice the `fig.cap` flag
which will use these variables to create captions underneath the respective
figures. Until you've completed all the parts, you may safely leave these
captions blank.

```{r code block to create descriptive captions}
caption_4 <- 'Variance explained of Principal Components of microarray intensity data. PC1 & PC2 account for 24.1% percent of the total variance explained.'
caption_5 <- 'Variance explained of PCA resultant Principal Components 1 & 2 of microarray intensity data stratified by colon cancer subtype.'
caption_8 <- 'Heatmap of filtered significant probe sets from microarray intensity data.'
```

## 4. Plot the variance explained and cumulative variance for the PCs
__Write a function, `plot_pca_variance`, that uses the results generated in part
3, `variance_tibble`, and returns a *plot* that contains both a barchart
representing the variance explained by each individual PC along with a
scatterplot (connected with a line) that displays the cumulative sum of the
variance explained across all the PCs. Provide appropriate labels for each
plot.__

*Hint*: On your plot, you want the x-axis to represent each principal component
in order of descending amounts of variance explained from left to right (i.e.
PC1, PC2, PC3, etc.). You may run into an issue where your axis is
automatically sorted differently. Please refer to discussions on lexicographical
ordering vs. numeric ordering.

```{r, code block to plot variance explained and cumulative variance explained, fig.cap = caption_4}
plot_pca_variance(variance_tibble)
```


## 5. Biplot of the first two principal components
As the first two PCs represent the first and second most amounts of variance, it
is common to see scatter plots of the scores of the first two PCs for each
sample. This biplot enables you to quickly see how your samples 'separate'
across the PCs that represent (hopefully) the majority of variance in your data.

__Write a function, `make_biplot` that uses the `pca_results` generated in part
1 and returns a *plot* of the first two principal components labeled by their
SixSubTypesClassification found in the `proj_metadata.csv`.__

*Hint*: You may access the values to plot by using `$x` (`pca_results$x`) and
selecting the columns representing PC1 and PC2.

*Warning*: Since the first and second PCs likely represent different amounts of
variance, visually interpreting these plots requires care as the scale of the
'importance' of the axes differ. 

```{r code block to make a biplot of PC1 and PC2, message = FALSE, fig.cap = caption_5}
make_biplot('proj_metadata.csv', pca_results)
```

## 6. Filter the differential_expression_results.csv for significant probes
We have provided you sample results of differential expression analysis
performed on the intensity data from part 1. We are going to extract out a list
of probes that are considered differentially expressed in this CSV and
eventually generate a heatmap of the normalized intensity values for these
selected probes.

__Write a function, `list_significant_probes`, that reads the
differential_expression_results.csv, filters the data to only contain
significant probes with a 'padj' of less than .01, and returns a *list* of the
significant probe IDs__. Have your function define two arguments, the path to a
CSV file (differential_expression_results.csv, in our case) and a user-specified
value for the 'padj' threshold.

*Hint*: In general, it is a good practice to build functions that are flexible
and do not contain hard-coded values so that you can reuse your function for
different applications or analyses with minimal changes. For instance, we have
you construct this function with a 'padj' value argument so that theoretically,
in the future, you could easily re-run it with a different value. For our
purposes, we will manually set this argument as .01.

```{r code block to filter DE probes, and return matrix of selected normalized intensity values}
sig_ids <- list_significant_probes('differential_expression_results.csv', .01)
head(sig_ids)
length(sig_ids)
```

## 7. Extract out the normalized intensity values for the significant probes 
Now that we have a list of significant probes, we want to make a visualization,
in the form of a heatmap, that will allow us to quickly determine if we see any
patterns or clusters amongst these differentially expressed probes. To do this,
we will extract out the intensity values from part 1 for these probes that are
significantly differentially expressed in part 6 and plot them in a heatmap.

__Write a function, `return_de_intensity`, that uses the list of significant
probes you generated in part 6 `sig_ids` and the example intensity data from
part 1 `intensity` to return a *matrix* of intensity values for just the
significant probes.__

```{r code block to return the intensity matrix for DE probes}
de_intensity <- return_de_intensity(intensity, sig_ids)
head(de_intensity, 2)
```

## 8. Generate a heatmap of normalized intensity values (color-blind friendly)
__Write a function, `heatmap_plot`, that uses the `de_intensity` results and
returns a heatmap *plot*. Have the function take three arguments: the
`de_intensity` results, a string specifying the RColorBrewer Palette and an
integer with the number of colors for that palette.__

*Hint*: Use the base R `heatmap()` function. For this example, we will only be
passing two arguments: the `matrix` of normalized intensity values from part 7,
and a color-blind friendly color palette. Look at the RColorBrewer documentation
and choose a suitable palette. Your usage should look something like this:
`heatmap(your_normalized_intensity_values, col = RColorBrewer_palette)`. The
`heatmap()` function will automatically scale data as well as perform
hierarchical clustering. For the purposes of this assignment, we will not go
in-depth into these topics, and you will run `heatmap()` with default options
besides `col`.

```{r code block to plot heatmap of normalized intensity values for DE probes, fig.cap = caption_8}
plot_heatmap(de_intensity, 11, 'RdBu')
```
